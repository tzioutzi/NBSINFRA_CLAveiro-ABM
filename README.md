# NBSINFRA_CLAveiro-ABM
The Aveiro model is a specific application of the Resilience and Sustainability Quantification Framework designed to assess Nature-Based Solutions projects within the city of Aveiro, Portugal. This case study is located in a former industrial area of Aveiro municipality, encompassing approximately 6,900m², with 6,350m² being permeable areas. The region faces challenges such as water quantity and quality issues due to heavy rainfall and urban runoff, making it an ideal setting for evaluating NBS.
Key aspects of the Aveiro model include:
NBS Interventions: the model focuses on evaluating an NBS that combines a detention basin and a constructed wetland to treat stormwater runoff. It also explores alternatives like stream meander restoration, nature-based retention ponds, enhancement of native vegetation, and urban agriculture.
Ecosystems and Focus Areas: the investigation covers fluvial environments along the Vilar Stream, natural green spaces, agricultural lands, and urban landscapes. The simulation specifically addresses biodiversity, water quality, flood regulation, urban agriculture, and recreational landscape value.
Modeling Framework: the Aveiro model is built using NetLogo 3D 6.4.0 and employs an agent-based approach, with a prismatic space of 118x160x19 patches, where each patch is a 10m cube. Static components (patches) represent ecosystems like fluvial, natural green, urban green, agricultural, and urban areas, while dynamic agents represent natural, urban, and fluvial vegetation, animals, and human populations.
Simulation Procedures: the simulation replicates complex interrelations among natural phenomena, physical infrastructure, and human actions. Procedures include soil water retention, vegetation status assessment, biodiversity assessment using the Shannon Diversity Index, and evaluation of community attraction. These processes are examined under changing seasonal conditions over a 12-month timeframe.
Scenarios: The model assesses various NBS alternatives, both primary (e.g., meander restoration, retention ponds) and secondary (combinations thereof), against a baseline scenario (no NBS intervention). It also simulates a disruptive flooding event occurring in August to test resilience, given the soil's reduced water retention capacity and increased community outdoor activities during that period.
Assessment: The assessment involves a comparative evaluation of performance values (soil water retention, vegetation status, biodiversity, community attraction) and Ecosystem Service Values (regulating, provisioning, cultural) across seasons and during flood events. The findings indicate seasonal variability in performance, with cultural services benefiting most from fluvial zone enhancement, and integrated solutions showing improved soil water retention and resilience to flooding.
